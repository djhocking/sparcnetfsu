Use Zotero for your reference manager and the R package `citr` for adding citations. The `references.bib` file should have all the references that you cite in the manuscript.

See the instructions for `citr` at: [https://github.com/crsh/citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr)

It might be worthwhile to use the `rticles` package to start a new paper. Alternatively, we can set up our own templates for journals we commonly publish in. Final formatting edits may have to be made in MS Word for journal submission. Alternatively, we can write papers in LaTeX using a template from a particular journal. I'm not sure it's worth that effort in most cases, especially if it then has to go to a different journal.
