Authoring Instructions
================

Use Zotero for your reference manager and the R package `citr` for
adding citations. The `references.bib` file should have all the
references that you cite in the manuscript.

It might be worthwhile to use the `rticles` package to start a new
paper. Alternatively, we can set up our own templates for journals we
commonly publish in. Final formatting edits may have to be made in MS
Word for journal submission. Alternatively, we can write papers in LaTeX
using a template from a particular journal. I’m not sure it’s worth that
effort in most cases, especially if it then has to go to a different
journal.
